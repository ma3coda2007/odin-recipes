    <p><h2>steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>First place a skillet on your stovetop and add about 1 Tbsp. of olive oil to it, set the stovetop to medium heat (350F 176C). You can actually leave it out because the meat has fat in it, but I always like to add it for a bit of flavor. Now let's combine all of our spices in a bowl and whisk them together. I recommend trying the recipe out as is first and then you can adjust according to your tastes the next time. :) Next let's bring our ground beef, spices, and tomato sauce over to the stove.</li>
        <li>Now let's add our ground beef to the hot skillet and using a spatula break up the meat and stir occasionally as it cooks until all brown. It won't take too long to cook the meat.</li>
        <li>Next let's drain the meat. I usually just tilt the skillet at about a 45 degree angle and let the fats drain to the bottom, then use a spoon and take most of it out. I like to leave about 1 Tbsp. left, to help keep the meat moist. Now add all of your seasonings and the tomato sauce. :)</li>
        <li>Next to finish the meat off, stir in the spices and tomato sauce really well, and then turn the heat to medium low and let the meat cook for about 3 or 4 more minutes. Then the ground beef taco meat will be ready to go.</li>
        <li>Now we need to cut up all of our toppings for our tacos. You can use individual bowls for each topping or use a cool taco platter. I have this cool ceramic taco platter that I like. Some toppings I really like using are diced tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and of course homemade guacamole. For the shells, I am using corn tortillas, but also like the corn hard shells, or flour tortillas.</li>
        <li>Now let's add whatever toppings we like to our tortillas. I pretty much added all of them, went very light on the jalape√±os...yes I am a wimp when it comes to heat/spicy. lol. Enjoy! You know you want to have an awesome taco party now don't you? :)</li>
